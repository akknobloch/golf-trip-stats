## Deployment

This application can be deployed to Vercel (recommended) or Siteground hosting. The admin panel is password-protected in production to prevent public access.

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy using the script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-vercel.sh
   ```

3. **Or deploy manually**:
   - Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and create a new project
   - Import your repository
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
     - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`
     - `NODE_ENV=production`

For detailed Vercel deployment instructions, see [VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md](VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md).
